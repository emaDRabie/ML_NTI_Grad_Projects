# ◖1◗ MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier

This project demonstrates a machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It includes both training scripts and a user-friendly web interface powered by Gradio.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and model training
- Evaluation with classification reports and confusion matrix
- Interactive web UI for digit prediction

## Demo

# ◖2◗ Heart Failure Clinical Prediction

This project implements machine learning models to predict the risk of heart failure using clinical records. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and an interactive web interface built with Gradio.

## Features

- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Multiple model training (MLP, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluation with classification reports, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC
- Interactive UI for risk prediction

## Demo
